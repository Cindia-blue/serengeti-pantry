# VMware Serengeti Cookbooks and Roles

This repository contains all the cookbooks and roles used in VMware Serengeti Project.
All cookbooks and roles are modified based on cookbooks and roles open sourced by [Infochimps](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-pantry).

## Main Changes
* Add support for deploying a Hadoop cluster using various Hadoop Distributions (e.g. Apache Hadoop, GreenPlum HD, Cloudera CDH, Hortonworks, etc.).
* The cookbooks are targeted for deploying a Hadoop 0.20 cluster with HDFS, MapReduce, Pig and Hive support.
* The cookbooks only work for CentOS 5.x .
